// CREATE A DND RANDOM ENCOUNTER GENERATOR WITH REACT

// Goals for this App

Inspiration: https://www.chaosgen.com/dnd5e/encounter

    + Accept user inputs from dropdown menus +

        - Select Party Difficulty [Levels 1-5, 6-10, 11-15]
             --- If select the Customize option, there will also be drop-downs for allowing treasure, perhaps specifc landmarks, or a type of NPC [are they friendly hostile etc]
        - There will be a button called "Create Encounter"

    + Generate a Random Encounter +

        - There will be a randomly generated amount of Monsters/NPCs called from this API: call https://api.open5e.com/monsters/ ${monsterPlaceholder}
            --- We will create an icon and a drop down arrow that will contain the generated NPCs specs
            --- The NPC will be of an equal challenge level to what was selected on the label
        - There will be an object/place from an Array we will make describing where we are at
        - There will be a verb from an Array we made describing what the NPC is doing
        - There will be a random appropriate level loot and potentially a magical item
            --- This magical item will be a level appropriate one drawn from this API "https://api.open5e.com/magicitems/"
            --- There will be a dropdown menu with the stats of the item taken from the API
